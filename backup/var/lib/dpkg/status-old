 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate
 packages.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 The objective of Certbot, Let's Encrypt, and the ACME (Automated
 Certificate Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible
 to set up an HTTPS server and have it automatically obtain a
 browser-trusted certificate, without any human intervention. This is
 accomplished by running a certificate management agent on the web
 server.
 .
 This agent is used to:
 .
   - Automatically prove to the Let's Encrypt CA that you control the website
   - Obtain a browser-trusted certificate and set it up on your web server
   - Keep track of when your certificate is going to expire, and renew it
   - Help you revoke the certificate if that ever becomes necessary.
 .
 This package contains the main application, including the standalone
 and the manual authenticators.

Description: C-Extensions for Python
 Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
 easy as Python itself. Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports
 more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.
 .
 The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
 additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables
 and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C
 code from Cython code.
 .
 This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and
 for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

Description: POSIX-compliant shell
 The Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is a POSIX-compliant shell derived
 from ash.
 .
 Since it executes scripts faster than bash, and has fewer library
 dependencies (making it more robust against software or hardware
 failures), it is used as the default system shell on Debian systems.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier
 Contains the following scripts, dependencies/recommendations shown in
 brackets afterwards:
 .
  - annotate-output: run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout,
    E for stderr) for every line of output.
  - archpath: Prints arch (tla/Bazaar) package names. Also supports
    calculating the package names for other branches. [tla | bazaar]
  - bts: A command-line tool for accessing the Debian Bug Tracking System, both
    to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and
    SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser, libauthen-sasl-perl,
    libnet-smtps-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl,
    bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given package.
    [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrappers around debi and debc respectively (see below)
    which allow them to be called from the CVS working directory.
    [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: wrapper around debrelease which allows it to be called
    from the CVS working directory. [cvs-buildpackage, dupload | dput,
    ssh-client]
  - cvs-debuild: A wrapper for cvs-buildpackage to use debuild as its package
    building program. [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian, gnupg |gnupg2]
  - dcmd: run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file
    with each of the files referenced therein. *
  - dcontrol: remotely query package and source control files for all Debian
    distributions. [liburl-perl, libwww-perl]
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary.
    [fakeroot]*
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to check
    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debi: Installs the current package by using the setuid root debpkg
    script described below.  It assumes that the current package has
    just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the
    parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.  The
    ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debpkg: A wrapper for dpkg used by debi to allow convenient testing
    of packages.  For debpkg to work, it needs to be made setuid root,
    and this needs to be performed by the sysadmin -- it is not
    installed as setuid root by default.  (Note that being able to run a
    setuid root debpkg is effectively the same as having root access to
    the system, so this should be done with caution.)  Having debpkg as
    a wrapper for dpkg can be a Good Thing (TM), as it decreases the
    potential for damage by accidental wrong use of commands in
    superuser mode (e.g., an inadvertent rm -rf * in the wrong directory
    is disastrous as many can attest to).
  - debrelease: A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which
    version to upload, and then calls dupload or dput to actually perform
    the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - debrepro: A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will
    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on
    a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the
    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg |gnupg2,
    debian-keyring, ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]
  - debuild: A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to
    avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc.
    Debuild will set up the proper environment for building a package.
    Debuild will use the fakeroot program to build the package by default, but
    can be instructed to use any other gain-root command, or can even be
    installed setuid root.  Debuild can also be used to run various of
    the debian/rules operations with the same root-gaining procedure.
    Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not
    have any major policy violations. [fakeroot, lintian, gnupg | gnupg2]*
  - deb-reversion: increases a binary package version number and repacks the
    package, useful for porters and the like.
  - dep3changelog: generate a changelog entry from a DEP3-style patch header.
  - desktop2menu: given a freedesktop.org desktop file, generate a skeleton
    for a menu file. [libfile-desktopentry-perl]
  - dget: Downloads Debian source and binary packages. Point at a .changes or
    .dsc to download all references files. Specify a package name to download
    it from the configured apt repository. [wget | curl]
  - diff2patches: extracts patches from a .diff.gz file placing them under
    debian/ or, if present, debian/patches. [patchutils]
  - dpkg-depcheck, dpkg-genbuilddeps: Runs a specified command (such as
    debian/rules build) or dpkg-buildpackage, respectively, to determine the
    packages used during the build process.  This information can be helpful
    when trying to determine the packages needed in the Build-Depends etc.
    lines in the debian/control file. [build-essential, strace]
  - dscextract: extract a single file from a Debian source package. [patchutils]
  - dscverify: check the signature and MD5 sums of a dsc file against the most
    current Debian keyring on your system. [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring]
  - edit-patch: add/edit a patch for a source package and commit the changes.
    [quilt | dpatch | cdbs]
  - getbuildlog: download package build logs from Debian auto-builders. [wget]
  - git-deborig: try to produce Debian orig.tar using git-archive(1).
    [libdpkg-perl, libgit-wrapper-perl, liblist-compare-perl,
    libstring-shellquote-perl, libtry-tiny-perl]
  - grep-excuses: grep britney's excuses to find out what is happening to your
    packages. [libdbd-pg-perl, libterm-size-perl, libyaml-syck-perl, wget, w3m]
  - hardening-check: report the hardening characteristics of a set of binaries.
  - list-unreleased: searches for packages marked UNRELEASED in their
    changelog.
  - ltnu (Long Time No Upload): List all uploads of packages by the
    given uploader or maintainer and display them ordered by the last
    upload of that package, oldest uploads first.
  - manpage-alert: locate binaries without corresponding manpages. [man-db]
  - mass-bug: mass-file bug reports. [bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - mergechanges: merge .changes files from the same release but built
    on different architectures.
  - mk-build-deps: Given a package name and/or control file, generate a binary
    package which may be installed to satisfy the build-dependencies of the
    given package. [equivs]
  - mk-origtargz: Rename upstream tarball, optionally changing the compression
    and removing unwanted files.
    [libfile-which-perl, unzip, xz-utils, file]
  - namecheck: Check project names are not already taken.
  - nmudiff: prepare a diff of this version (presumably an NMU against the
    previously released version (as per the changelog) and submit the diff
    to the BTS. [patchutils, mutt]
  - origtargz: fetch the orig tarball of a Debian package from various sources,
    and unpack it.
  - plotchangelog: display information from a changelog graphically using
    gnuplot. [libtimedate-perl, gnuplot]

    files. [python3-magic]
  - svnpath: Prints the path to the Subversion repository of a Subversion
    checkout. Also supports calculating the paths for branches and
    tags in a repository independent fashion. Used by debcommit to generate
    svn tags. [subversion]
  - tagpending: runs from a Debian source tree and tags bugs that are to be
    closed in the latest changelog as pending. [libsoap-lite-perl]
  - transition-check: Check a list of source packages for involvement in
    transitions for which uploads to unstable are currently blocked.
    [libwww-perl, libyaml-syck-perl]
  - uscan: Automatically scan for and download upstream updates.  Uscan can
    also call a program such as uupdate to attempt to update the Debianised
    version based on the new update.  Whilst uscan could be used to release
    the updated version automatically, it is probably better not to without

Description: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.

Description: Scripts to help with executable debhelper files
 Debhelper (in compat level 9 and above) allows its config files to be
 executable, and uses the output of such scripts as if it was the
 content of the config file.
 .
 To ease and standardize the most common tasks, this package provides
 a few solutions to help constructing such executable scripts:
 .
  * A way to ease variable substitution, from environment variables or
    dpkg-architecture.
  * Ability to filter files by architecture or build profile, within a
    single debhelper control file.
  * An extension to dh_install and dh_installman, with the ability to
    rename files.

Description: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: Linux container runtime
 Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which operates at
 the process level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation
 and repeatability across servers.
 .
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems,
 private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and client. Using docker.io on non-amd64 hosts
 is not supported at this time. Please be careful when using it on anything
 besides amd64.
 .
 Also, note that kernel version 3.8 or above is required for proper operation of
 the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have subtle and/or glaring
 issues.

 By default (and hence on installation) it creates swapfile twice as
 big as the present RAM amount with an upper limit of 2 GB.
 .
 It's also very helpful when included in SD card, USB stick or disk
 images which are distributed and run on many machines with different
 amount of RAM, e.g. different models of the Raspberry Pi or cloud
 images.

Description: Debian package upload tool
 dput allows you to put one or more Debian packages into the archive.  This
 package also includes a dcut utility which can be used to generate and / or
 upload a commands file for the Debian FTP archive upload queue.
 .
 dput includes some tests to verify that the package is policy-compliant.
 It offers the possibility to run lintian before the upload. It can also
 run dinstall in dry-run-mode, when having used an appropriate upload method.
 This is very useful to see if the upload will pass dinstall sanity checks
 in the next run.
 .
 It is intended mainly for Debian maintainers only, although it can
 also be useful for people maintaining local APT repositories.

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create trivial Debian packages.
 Typically these packages contain only dependency information, but they
 can also include normal installed files like other packages do.
 .
 One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
 purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages so
 that these will be automatically installed, upgraded, or removed.
 .
 Another use is to circumvent dependency checking: by letting dpkg
 think a particular package name and version is installed when it
 isn't, you can work around bugs in other packages' dependencies.
 (Please do still file such bugs, though.)

Description: support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support
 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package
 containing the main executable. The available packages are:
 .
  exim4-daemon-light
  exim4-daemon-heavy
 .
 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also
 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.
 .

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .

Description: Automates interactive applications
 Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
 Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
 the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
 applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
 .
 This package contains the expect binary and several Expect based scripts.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: Identify, read, write, erase, and verify BIOS/ROM/flash chips
 flashrom is a tool for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
 flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware/optionROM
 images in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of
 network cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which
 can program flash chips.
 .
 It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32/40/48,
 and BGA chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel
 flash, or SPI.
 .
 The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it
 proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images.
 .
 It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a
 flash chip.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package only contains the sans, sans-bold, serif, serif-bold,
 mono and mono-bold variants. For additional variants, see the
 ttf-dejavu-extra package.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

 secret key material for OpenPGP and S/MIME use.  The agent also
 provides a passphrase cache, which is used by pre-2.1 versions of
 GnuPG for OpenPGP operations.  Without this package, trying to do
 secret-key operations with any part of the modern GnuPG suite will
 fail.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: DHCP client for automatically obtaining an IP address
 This is the Internet Software Consortium's DHCP client.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package isc-dhcp-common.

 Algorithm::Diff::XS is a Perl diff utility module based on Joe Schaefer's
 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description: Perl module to resynchronize multiple control flows
 Async::Mergepoint is a module designed to provide a way to resynchronize
 multiple parallel control flows. Often in program logic, multiple different
 steps need to be taken that are independent of each other, but their total
 result is needed before the next step can be taken. In synchronous code, the
 usual approach is to do them sequentially.
 .
 An asynchronous or event-based program could do this, but if each step
 involves some IO idle time, better overall performance can often be gained by
 running the steps in parallel. A Async::MergePoint object can then be used to
 wait for all of the steps to complete, before passing the combined result of
 each step on to the next stage.

 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: C interface to the clang library
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 based on the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the
 GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This package contains the clang library.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.

Description: Perl module that automatically generates accessors
 Class::Accessor automagically generates accessor/mutator methods for your
 class. Most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
 pasting. If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare

Description: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.

Description: perl module to create bubble-babble fingerprints
 Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
 either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
 a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
 Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
 as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
 to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
 they look more like words than a string of hex characters.
 .
 Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
 (and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
 implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
 The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
 digested using Digest::SHA, and run through bubblebabble
 to create the key fingerprint.

Version: 1.05-1
Depends: perl
Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"

 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

Description: module for operations awaiting completion
 A Future object represents an operation that is currently in progress, or
 has recently completed. It can be used in a variety of ways to manage the
 flow of control, and data, through an asynchronous program.
 .
 Some futures represent a single operation and are explicitly marked as ready
 by calling the done or fail methods. These are called "leaf" futures here,
 and are returned by the new constructor.
 .
 Other futures represent a collection sub-tasks, and are implicitly marked as
 ready depending on the readiness of their component futures as required.
 These are called "dependent" futures here, and are returned by the various
 wait_* and need_* constructors.
 .
 It is intended that library functions that perform asynchronous operations
 would use Future objects to represent outstanding operations, and allow their
 calling programs to control or wait for these operations to complete. The
 implementation and the user of such an interface would typically make use of
 different methods on the class. The methods below are documented in two
 sections; those of interest to each side of the interface.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.

 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a

 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.

Description: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

Description: Perl module implementing object oriented interface to SSL sockets
 This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that
 uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server
 or client.  IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one
 needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application:
 multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and
 SSL version selection.  As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with
 mod_perl.
 .
 IO::Socket::SSL uses IPv6 if libio-socket-ip-perl (>= 0.20) or
 libio-socket-inet6-perl is installed.

Description: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
 The IO::String module provide the IO::File interface for in-core
 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,
 format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left,
 format_name, format_top_name.

 IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.
 .
 The libio-stringy-perl package provides the following modules:
 .
  * IO::AtomicFile  - write a file which is updated atomically
  * IO::InnerFile   - define a file inside another file
  * IO::Lines       - IO:: interface for reading/writing an array of lines
  * IO::Scalar      - IO:: interface for reading/writing a scalar
  * IO::ScalarArray - IO:: interface for reading/writing an array of scalars
  * IO::Stringy     - I/O on in-core objects like strings and arrays
  * IO::Wrap        - wrap raw filehandles in IO::Handle interface
  * IO::WrapTie     - wrap tieable objects in IO::Handle interface

 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library for the main Kerberos v5 API
 used by applications and Kerberos clients.

 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

 while still decompressing at this very high speed.

 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.

 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.

 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: module providing low-level HTTP connection client
 The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the
 Net::HTTP class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The
 HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class
 supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET.
 You can mix its methods with reading and writing from the socket directly.
 This is not necessarily a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.

Description: Perl extension for manipulating IPv4/IPv6 addresses
 Net::IP provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
 The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate IP
 objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses.
 There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the functions. Most
 subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.

Description: Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP
 Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
 for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
 not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,
 and it's not a pain to specify that.
 .
 This package is deprecated. Net::SMTP (in perl core) has support for SMTP
 over SSL, and also for STARTTLS, since version 1.28 (included in Perl 5.22).

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of
 other modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest

 .
 People will also find it useful in real-world applications that need to:
 .
 1. Serve static contents directly from memory.
 2. Wrap the upstream response with custom header and footer (kinda like the
    addition module but with contents read directly from the config file and
    Nginx variables).
 3. Merge contents of various "Nginx locations" (i.e., subrequests) together in
    a single main request (using echo_location and its friends).

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL audio API (shared library)

 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft shared library.

 It is intended to suit a wide range of interactive audio applications,
 including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live
 music performances.  It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very
 high quality stereo music. The current features are:
 .
  Bit-rates from 6 kb/s 510 kb/s
  Sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz
  Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
  Support for both constant bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR)
  Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-band
  Support for speech and music
  Support for mono and stereo
  Support for up to 255 channels (multistream frames)
  Dynamically adjustable bitrate, audio bandwidth, and frame size
  Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)

Description: perl OSSP::UUID - OSSP uuid Perl Binding
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
 and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
 DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
 (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
 based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).
 .
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
 of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
 to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
 generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 OSSP::uuid provides two Perl APIs:
 .
 The OO-style API is a wrapper around the C-style API and intended for
 high-level and regular programming.
 .
 The C-style API is a direct mapping of the OSSP uuid ISO-C API to Perl and
 is intended for low-level programming.
 .
 The Debian package provides also Data::UUID interface so OSSP::uuid can be
 used as free replacement for non-DFSG Perl module.

Description: iterative, recursive file finder
 Path::Iterator::Rule iterates over files and directories to identify
 ones matching a user-defined set of rules.  The API is based heavily on
 File::Find::Rule, but with more explicit distinction between matching
 rules and options that influence how directories are searched.  A
 Path::Iterator::Rule object is a collection of rules (match criteria)
 with methods to add additional criteria.  Options that control
 directory traversal are given as arguments to the method that generates
 an iterator.
 .
 Here is a summary of features for comparison to other file finding
 modules:
  * provides many "helper" methods for specifying rules
  * offers (lazy) iterator and flattened list interfaces
  * custom rules implemented with callbacks
  * breadth-first (default) or pre- or post-order depth-first searching
  * follows symlinks (by default, but can be disabled)
  * directories visited only once (no infinite loop; can be disabled)
  * doesn't chdir during operation
  * provides an API for extensions
 .
 As a convenience, the PIR module is an empty subclass of this one that
 is less arduous to type for one-liners.

Description: file path utility
 Path::Tiny attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with
 file paths. It is friendlier to use than File::Spec and provides easy
 access to functions from several other core file handling modules.
 .
 It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class,
 nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32
 platforms.  Even then, it might break if you try something particularly
 obscure or tortuous. (Quick! What does this mean:
 "///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././"? And how does it differ on
 Win32?)

Description: system interface for user-level packet capture
 libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level
 network monitoring.  Applications include network statistics collection,
 security monitoring, network debugging, etc.
 .
 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this
 functionality, the libpcap authors created this system-independent API
 to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several
 system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.

Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided

 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 Ref::Util::XS is the XS implementation of Ref::Util, which provides several
 functions to help identify references in a more convenient way than the usual
 approach of examining the return value of ref.
 .
 You should use Ref::Util::XS by installing Ref::Util itself (packaged as
 libref-util-perl): If the system doesn't have Recommends turned off, you will
 get libref-util-xs-perl automatically. Ref::Util::XS will be used
 automatically, providing a significant speed boost to everything that uses
 Ref::Util.
 .
 See Ref::Util for full documentation of the available functions.

Description: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 both encoder and decoder, it is enough to depend on a particular version of
 Sereal and you'll get the most recent released versions of Sereal::Encoder

Description: Perl module for sorting of revision (and similar) numbers
 The Sort::Versions module allows easy sorting (via comparisons) of mixed text
 and numeric strings, similar to the complex "version numbers" that many
 revision control packages and shared library systems use. For an explanation
 of the algorithm, it's easiest to look at these examples:
 .
  1.1   <  1.2
  1.1a  <  1.2
  1.1   <  1.1.1
  1.1   <  1.1a
  1.1.a <  1.1a
  1     <  a
  a     <  b
  1     <  2
 .
  (special handling for leading zeros)
  0002  <  1
  1.06  <  1.5
 .
  (a hyphen binds looser than a period)

 It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational or
 irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth, aliasing,
 and rejection level parameters are all configurable; alternatively, simple
 `preset' configurations may be selected.
 .
 A simple API is provided that allows interfacing using commonly-used sample
 formats and buffering schemes.

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

Description: module to create simple lightweight record-like structures
 Struct::Dumb creates record-like structure types, similar to the struct
 keyword in C, C++ or C#, or Record in Pascal. An invocation of this module
 will create a construction function which returns new object references with
 the given field values. These references all respond to lvalue methods that
 access or modify the values stored.
 .
 It's specifically and intentionally not meant to be an object class. You
 cannot subclass it. You cannot provide additional methods. You cannot apply
 roles or mixins or metaclasses or traits or antlers or whatever else is in
 fashion this week.
 .
 On the other hand, it is tiny, creates cheap lightweight array-backed
 structures, uses nothing outside of core. It's intended simply to be a
 slightly nicer way to store data structures, where otherwise you might be
 tempted to abuse a hash, complete with the risk of typoing key names. The
 constructor will croak if passed the wrong number of arguments, as will
 attempts to refer to fields that don't exist.

 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)

 subname NAME, CODEREF
 .
 Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
 omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return
 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
 You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To
 allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .

 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,

 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

Description: module for ensuring that a platform has weaken support
 One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's weaken function is
 that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.
 .
 While this isn't necessarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based Perl
 environment, some operating system distributions only include the pure-Perl
 versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then "missing" from
 the platform, despite passing a dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.
 .
 The normal solution is to manually write tests in each distribution to ensure
 that weaken is available.
 .
 Task::Weaken restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do once
 in your Makefile.PL, rather than something you have to write extra tests for
 each time you write a module.

Description: Perl module to assert reference counts
 Test::Refcount asserts that an object's reference count is as expected. Since
 Perl's automatic memory management algorithm uses reference counting to keep
 track of which 'things' (ie, scalars, objects, etc.) are in use, problems
 like circular references (where a variable points to itself) can prevent Perl
 from properly freeing them.
 .
 If the assertion fails; that is, if the actual reference count is different
 to what was expected, a trace of references to the object is printed, using
 the Devel::FindRef module. It is probably most useful as part of a
 comprehensive module author test suite.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.

Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Description: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.
 .
 Note from upstream: The use of this module in new code is strongly
 discouraged. Other modules are available which provide more straightforward
 and consistent interfaces. In particular, XML::LibXML is highly recommended.
 XML::Twig is another excellent alternative.These modules are packaged as
 libxml-libxml-perl and libxml-twig-perl in Debian.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called a "laboratory", in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 4.3.0.

 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other
 programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network
 debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
 connection you would need and has several interesting built-in
 capabilities.
 .
 This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat, including support
 for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Provides a package management service
 PackageKit allows performing simple software management tasks over a DBus
 interface e.g. refreshing the cache, updating, installing and removing
 software packages or searching for multimedia codecs and file handlers.
 .
 The work is done by backends which make use of the package manager shipped by
 the corresponding distribution. PackageKit is not meant to replace
 advanced tools like Synaptic.
 .
 The main benefits are:
  - unified interface on several distributions
  - fine grained privileges by using PolicyKit
  - independency from a running desktop session during the processing

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.28' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.28') instead.

 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: Python library exposing cryptographic recipes and primitives (Python 3)
 The cryptography library is designed to be a "one-stop-shop" for
 all your cryptographic needs in Python.
 .
 As an alternative to the libraries that came before it, cryptography
 tries to address some of the issues with those libraries:
  - Lack of PyPy and Python 3 support.
  - Lack of maintenance.
  - Use of poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known
    side-channel attacks).
  - Lack of high level, "Cryptography for humans", APIs.
  - Absence of algorithms such as AES-GCM.
  - Poor introspectability, and thus poor testability.
  - Extremely error prone APIs, and bad defaults.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of cryptography.

Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library (Python 3)
 The "gpg" Python module is, for the most part, a direct interface to

 classes defined here -- they correspond directly to certain object
 types in GPGME for C.
 .
 Features:
  * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library. Supports
    all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
    Callback functions may be written in pure Python.
  * Ability to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify data.
  * Ability to list keys, export and import keys, and manage the keyring.
  * Fully object-oriented with convenient classes and modules.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Description: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 3.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 3.x.

Description: Daemon to use a Hardware TRNG
 The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number
 generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's
 PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
 .
 It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
 tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
 kernel entropy pool.
 .
 This increases the bandwidth of the /dev/random device, from a source that
 does not depend on outside activity.  It may also improve the quality
 (entropy) of the randomness of /dev/random.
 .
 A TRNG kernel module such as hw_random, or some other source of true
 entropy that is accessible as a device or fifo, is required to use this
 package.
 .
 This is an unofficial version of rng-tools which has been extensively
 modified to add multithreading and a lot of new functionality.

 UDP, TCP, SSL). It provides forking, logging and tracing, different
 modes for interprocess communication and many more options.
 .
 It can be used, for example, as a TCP relay (one-shot or daemon),
 as an external socksifier, as a shell interface to Unix sockets,
 as an IPv6 relay, as a netcat and rinetd replacement, to redirect
 TCP-oriented programs to a serial line, or to establish a relatively
 secure environment (su and chroot) for running client or server shell
 scripts inside network connections. Socat supports sctp as of 1.7.0.

 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description: global hotkey daemon for Linux
 Triggerhappy watches connected input devices for certain key presses
 or other input events and runs administrator-configured
 commands when they occur. Unlike other hotkey daemons, it runs as a
 persistent, systemwide service and therefore can be used even
 outside the context of a user or X11 session.
 .
 It can handle a wide variety of devices (keyboards, joysticks,
 wiimote, etc.), as long as they are presented by the kernel as
 generic input devices. No kernel patch is required. The daemon is
 a userspace program that polls the /dev/input/event? interfaces
 for incoming key, button and switch events. A single daemon can
 monitor multiple input devices and can dynamically add additional
 ones. Hotkey handlers can be assigned to dedicated (tagged) devices
 or globally.
 .
 For example, this package might be useful on a headless system to
 use input events generated by a remote control to control an
 mpd server, but can also be used to allow the adjustment of audio
 and network status on a notebook without relying on user specific
 configuration.
 .
 Key combinations are supported as well as the hotplugging of devices
 using a udev hotplug script; the running daemon can also be influenced
 by a client program, e.g. to temporarily pause the processing of
 events or switch to a different set of hotkey bindings.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 /etc/wgetrc c43064699caf6109f4b3da0405c06ebb
Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: X Keyboard Extension (XKB) configuration data
 This package contains configuration data used by the X Keyboard
 Extension (XKB), which allows selection of keyboard layouts when
 using a graphical interface.
 .
 Every X11 vendor provides its own XKB data files, so keyboard layout
 designers have to send their layouts to several places.  The
 xkeyboard-config project has been launched at FreeDesktop in order
 to provide a central repository that could be used by all vendors.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
