Description: Dput is a tool for uploading packages into Debian.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        The features include:
        
        * Test of the GnuPG signature on the source control file (``*.dsc``).
        
        * Verification of the checksums in the source control file.
        
        * Support for MD5 and SHA checksums.
        
        * Check for unnecessary or missing tarballs.
        
        * Running Lintian before putting the package into the archive.
        
        * Running Dinstall after the package is in the archive and making sure that
          the package will be put on the correct server.
        
        * Running user-defined commands before and after an upload.
        
        A lot of the tests can be run without really putting the package
        into the archive.
